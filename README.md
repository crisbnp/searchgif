# Search your favourite GIF

- This project is bootstrapped with Creat React App.
- It uses Giphy API (Search endpoint)
- When user search for a Gif (query) in the search bar, user should see gifs related to query rendered on the page
- The first 7 images it returns should visually look like this
- When user clicks on a gif, user will be redirected to Giphy view url.

Approach to doing this project:

- Breaks the app to 3 components: SearchForm, GifList (for rendering GifCard) and GifCard (for each Gif)
- Worked on functionality of the search bar and ensure it returns the correct data
- Styling the page accordingly
- Added integration tests to the app (React Testing Library/Jest)

What I would have improved:

- Added Typescript to project
- Worked on styling: when user clicks gif, modal pops up
- Worked on more functionality: when user clicks gif, there is an option on copying the gif on modal

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
